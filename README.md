# Hello
#This is just a test repository to start with github.
# how ever i am still not able to upload a local directory as a git repo to my account. It just shows errors like you donot have access
# and make sure directory or repo exists
#the opposite works fine like i set up an empty project and clone it and then upload it, then all is fine.
